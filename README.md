# LM botting tweaks
## Few simple rules to follow in order to minimize risks/ban ratio. This is not 100% working method, this is what worked for me very well and took 1000s of accounts to achieve minimal ban damages. By no means it means you won't get banned - but it does lower risk factors (for me)
To reach C25 and make full unlinked hyper this way takes a while. Probably longer than "Push to 25 asap" - it might be less comfortable but results were way better.
I mean... you also wouldnt bang a hooker without a rubber just because it feels better, would you?

### Essential
#### Proxies
I can't stress this enough. There are thousands of bots running over proxies. Everyone tries to save as much $ as possible and goes for shared or semi/dedicated proxies.
Which would normally be fine if everyone used different provider, however this is not the case. Most of the users use one of the major providers therefore there is a chance to have shared proxy with other botters. Moreover people tend to use multiple accounts per proxy so imagine sharing that with someone who runs 5 accs/per proxy.
#### Mass bot guilds
Dont even get me started here.
#### Guild hopping
Dont swap guilds too much if you do swap make sure to stay in next guild at least few days. Got a delivery in protected? Offer buyer discount if bots can stay in his guild for few days.
#### Delivering rss
Send only from 1 account at once to same target. Do that in zone 1/2 and follow guild hopping rule.
#### Offline/maintenance
If your bot was offline or there was maintenace make sure accounts in hive are stopped once you start. Accounts will start to supply/hunt same monster all at once. Mass botting sign
Instead - enable them 1 by 1 in 10 mins intervals.
#### KVK
24h shield and stop gathering.


Do your own research - don't grab the cheapest proxy from the first provider you found on google, use alternative providers.

### New accounts - creating new accounts, and staying in protected
You might wanna create accounts at some point. Whatever method for creating accounts you using make sure to always record following information.
IGGID
UUID
Time and date of creation
City/Country of Creation
UUID is must for unlinked accounts - as long as you have it, when access key expires UUID generate new one.
I personally had bad experience and created my own creation scripts, they will be shared once I am out of LM.

#### Academy lvl 1-13
When new account is started I **disable any kind of speedups except troop speedups** and let accounts slowly reach level 13.
**Gathering** - Only gather clearable tiles, sending delay 10
**Research** - Military (Training speed only) > MH > Familliars(pact3 unlock) > Economy - This way accounts generate a lot of bags, familliars will be explained later.
**Buildings** - Priority Academy - Lvl 24. Enable only 4 basic rss buildings and full manors in template. Keep empty other rss bulding slots. This way account can grow and eventually at lvl 24 you will decide what hyper do you want. For Familliar buildings I use 1x gym,1x spire, rest springs.
**Talents** - Research + Construction - Army capacity - gathering speed.
**Gear** - For every account I set 2x construtcion speed trinket, 2x research speed trinket,familliar gear, 2x hunting trinket, dwarven boots, conquest helm, trident, noceros weapon, research gloves
**Army** - I set 20k inf, 20k ranged,200k cav and disable healing (only sanctuary)

#### Academy lvl 13-16
Now it is time to create and join the guild.
**NO HIVES, NOT SUPPLYING, NO BOT LOOKING STUFF**
When in protected, it is full of bots. There are two strategies.
1. For each bot you have create its own guild and let it be R5 - In 24-48 hours your guild will have 81 members as chineese bots will autojoin and your helps will be filled.
2. Create multiple guilds and spread your bots more-less equally, max 11 bots per guild.
3. Find fellow botters in the same kingdom and make a deal to create closed guild , 30 bots per guild (to avoid disbanding) - make sure your co-botters follow the same rules as you do.

Explanation:
1. The safest option. Even if guild gets hit by banhammer, r5 is usually only "suspended". Suspended accounts are easy to recover. If you still get banned you lost one account.
2. Same as above, usually good if you made like 30 accounts (as you dont wanna create 30 guilds). In case of ban wave, you are not loosing your full botting setup.
3. Good if you have trusted team, works same as no.2. In case of hit you will loose only part of the setup.

**Join guild slowly** - joining delay between each bot at least 1800 seconds.

**Hunting** - enable hunting, only full health - no stealing
**Building** - When academy 16 is reached dont push towards aca 17. Accounts should have chapter 8 and familliars are unlocked. Build all Fam buidlings up to level 16.
**Familiars** - Don't forget to enable familliar training - Aquiris is the most important one from 1st pact. Gnome and territe are cool as well.

**Speedups** - enable research speedups if you want. Enable building speedups for fam buildings.

**Heroes** - When your academy hits 16 it might be the right time to switch to the elite hero stages in order to get medals. Trickster > Construction speed dude with beard (fuck i forgot name). > Scarlet lass (that foxy girl with daggers and MH energy bonus).

#### Academy lvl 17-20
Your bots have academly lvl 17 now, decent amount of troops, nice talents and what not.
Talents - Change to research speed > construction speed > gathering speed > army capacity   . You have enough troops to clear tiles now.

**Gathering** - in order get way more rss and bags, relocate your bots to the edge of zone 3 (border zone 2/3) and enable gathering only lvl 3 and 4 tiles. Make sure only clearable tiles will be gathered.

**Speedups** - Use only research speedups for this part.

#### Academy lvl 21-24
**Army** - choose different leader for each bot. You know how does 30 oath keepers look like? Like bots.
After reaching academy 24 you should have enough gems for Treasure trove - max it.

If you have many accounts in 1 guild, split them.

Now it is also time to choose what hypers will those bots be. Adjust rss buildings that way
**Gear** - Select gear to build based on type of hyper (like terror vials for ore, wyrm seals for stone etc)
**Familliars** - Either Build your fam buildings to lvl 20 and set pact 3 (trickster,stars,gnome) - if already unlocked OR keep them lvl 16 and focus on  pact 1 + pact 2 rss boost fams for the type of hyper you need. Evil weevil is also essention, other interesting one is harpy.

**Heroes** - You will have enough time to train heroes until all resource buildings are level 24. 1st RSS boost hero (based on your hyper) and gold production boost midget is what you are looking for.

**Buildings** - Resources (with manor) up to level 24.

**speedups** enable for research and buildings.
When your resource buildings are level 24, your leader will be approx lvl 57.

**Finally** enable building of rss buildings to lvl 25, enable autopurchase of gold hammer in the gem tab.

Now it can be already moved to your main guild/ rss guild. Enable rss talents , disable gathering, enable shield all the time. Even now, follow no mass bot guilds. The best is to store bots in guild with actual players. Your accounts will now hype about 1.5m (3m for food) + 300k gold/hour.
